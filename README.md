### BEFORE YOUR FIRST TURN:
1. Shuffle the deck
2. Roll the D6 and draw that many cards (you can put the rest of the cards off to the side; you won’t need them)

### EACH TURN:
1. Play a card from your hand
2. Use the <a href="#feedback">FEEDBACK</a> table and the <a href="#features">FEATURES</a> table to derive a prompt (e.g. the prompt for the five of hearts would be “suggestion about the food”. Eight of diamonds would be “rumor about the staff”. The ace of spades would be “complaint about the clientele”.)
3. Roll the D6 and use the <a href="#importance">IMPORTANCE</a> table to determine how important future travelers will find this aspect of your tavern experience.
4. Write a sentence or two (or three…) about this aspect of your tavern experience, keeping in mind its importance to future travelers.

### AFTER

PLAYING ALL YOUR CARDS:
1. Write a short, descriptive title that sums up your review
2. Choose a fair rating for the tavern (1-5 stars)
3. Double-check your ad for spelling and grammatical errors
4. Post your review [somewhere fellow travelers are likely to see it](https://brosen.itch.io/tavern-critic)
